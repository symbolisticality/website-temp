			<h1>
				made a website ig?!
			</h1>
			<p>
				this post was primarily just a placeholder so this page isn't empty until i have something to post here but that's boring so here's a little insight on my thoughts while making this site:
			</p>
			<p>
				i randomly came accross some neat looking websites while browsing the internet and since i've been into server related topics recently, i thought "why not make a website myself". so i started working on it.
			</p>
			<p>
				my original idea was theming it around old photographs my great-grandparents took, obviously i scrapped that idea. it didn't really give me any creative inspiration. while taking a break for a while i was reading something on dithering effects and thought the "floyd-steinberg" dithering model seemed interesting, so i used it on a couple images i had on my computer and put them on the earlier version of this site.
			</p>
			<p>
				i really liked the monochrome, yet detailed look. it doesn't add too many complicated elements while still capturing important details. so that's what i went with, i searched public domain archives for images i liked, applied the dithering effect on them and built the site around them. i'm pretty happy with how it turned out :> !!!
