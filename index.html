<b>" saw another bird" by Phil Elverum</b>

so what? i saw another raven.
i actually see them all the time
i hear their voices talking
	about what the rest of us don't know

i'm a fool on the ground below them
	on my phone beneath the sky
	but i know there's no one walking, really,
		through these dreams i have

in the daylight i do all this work that needs to get done
	and i leave the mind of night

i can't remember having crossed a threshold
	between the dust and the alive
	so when a raven starts a conversation
		i just stand there and blank out

but i'm wrong!

there is another world inside this one,
	it shines:

	these birds trying for my attention
		and my wordless reply
